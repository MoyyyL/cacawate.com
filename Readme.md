# My Personal Website Project

Hey there! Welcome to my personal website project. This is the initial landing page I've created as part of my web development journey.

## Current Status

I'm actively working on this project, though I've hit a few bumps along the way:

- **Webpack challenges**: Currently learning how to properly configure and use Webpack
- **GitHub mishap**: Accidentally deleted my original repository (lesson learned!)
- **Learning process**: Using various resources including ChatGPT to troubleshoot issues

## What's Next

I'm focusing on:
- Mastering Webpack fundamentals
- Implementing best practices for project structure
- Gradually adding more features and content

## Enjoy!

Feel free to look around, and check back later for updates as I continue to develop this site!
